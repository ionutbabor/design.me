To take advantage of a callback on the select dropdown, add option_selection.js
and customize the JS in timber.productPage as needed.

Currently, timber.productPage does the following:
- Hides your <select> tag from above
- Breaks out the product variants into separate product options, if more than one exists
- Generates a <select> tag for each product option
- Enables/disables elements based on variant availability

Callback notes:
- Keep the callback available to the global scope (window.selectCallback) so that advanced
addons can override it.
* E.g. multiple currencies http://docs.shopify.com/manual/configuration/store-customization/currencies-and-translations/currencies/how-to-toggle-between-two-currencies
